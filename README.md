Database Project Requirements
The objective of this project is to design, implement, and manipulate a relational database using Microsoft SQL Server (or other). Throughout the project, you will gain practical experience with database concepts and SQL operations. Your database should include the following components and functionalities:

1. Database Design
Create a Database: Design and create a database for a small business or organisation, such as an online store, or school.
Define Tables: Identify and create tables necessary to store the required data, including:
Primary Key: Ensure each table has an auto-incremented primary key (PK) to uniquely identify each record.
Foreign Key: Define foreign key (FK) constraints to establish relationships between tables.
Many-to-Many Relationships: Implement at least one many-to-many relationship using a junction table.
Indexes: Create indexes to optimise queries. Use both unique and non-unique indexes where appropriate.
Data Types: Use a variety of data types (e.g., int, varchar, datetime) in your tables as appropriate to your data.
2. Data Manipulation 
Insert Operations: Insert sample data into each table to adequately populate the database. Write scripts using multi-row inserts.
Update Operations: Write queries to update existing data in the tables,   demonstrate modifying specific fields.
Delete Operations: Write queries to remove specific records from the tables, practice with both conditional deletions and full table truncations.
3. Data Retrieval and Queries
Write a minimum of three SQL SELECT statements that meet the following requirements: 

Utilise at least three aggregate functions, such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.
One of the SELECT statements should be structured to support pagination, using clauses like OFFSET, FETCH NEXT, TOP, etc.
Demonstrate data aggregation by grouping the results based on one or more columns, using the GROUP BY clause.
Implement the ORDER BY clause to sort the retrieved data in both ascending and descending order.
4. Table Joins
Join Two Tables: Write queries to retrieve combined information from two related tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, etc.
Join Three Tables: Extend queries to incorporate data combining from three related tables, showcasing more complex relationships.
Create a View: create a view which combines 3 different tables using JOIN.
5. Procedures/Functions/Triggers
Create at least one:
SQL Stored procedure 
SQL function
SQL trigger
Manual transaction
